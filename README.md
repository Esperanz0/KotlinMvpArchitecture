# KotlinMvpArchitecture
Clean MVP Architecture with Dagger2 + Retrofit2 + Fresco + GenericRecyclerAdapter. 

This repo contains demo module which retrieves mars images from the NASA API. The repo's main purpose is reducing spending time on starting new projects or adding new modules to your existing project. You can add new modules with just 2-3 clicks without writing any code. I have developed an Android Studio template for it. [You can check that KotlinMvpTemplate from here.](https://github.com/burakeregar/KotlinMvpTemplate)

I have seperated activity dependencies/components from AppComponent to avoid conflicts. KotlinMvpTemplate generates all of required dependency classes, presenters etc. for each module automatically.
