# KotlinMvpArchitecture
Clean MVP Architecture with Dagger2 + Retrofit2 + Fresco + GenericRecyclerAdapter. 

This repo contains demo module which retrieves mars images from the NASA API. The main purpose of the repo is to reduce the time spent on starting a new project or adding new modules to your existing project. You can add new modules with just 2-3 clicks without writing any code. I have developed an Android Studio template for it. [You can check that KotlinMvpTemplate from here.](https://github.com/burakeregar/KotlinMvpTemplate)

I have seperated activity dependencies/components from AppComponent to avoid conflicts. KotlinMvpTemplate generates all of required dependency classes, presenters etc. for each module automatically.
